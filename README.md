This was made in hand with a tutorial found at https://youtu.be/JL_gRdf5ESs .

# Instructions
1) Clone Lidgrens repo and build their DLL file as mentioned in the video.
2) Add the DLL to your Unity project in a "References" folder, and to the root directory of your server folder.  You will have to add the reference to your project in visual studio's UI (also discussed in the video).
3) Profit $$$
